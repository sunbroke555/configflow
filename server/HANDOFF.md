# Go rewrite — handoff for the coordinating session

Read this first when you pick up the Go rewrite in a new session. It is written for the coordinator
(the session that briefs, verifies and records work packages), not for the porting agents; they read
`PORTING.md`.

## Goal and standing decisions (maintainer, 2026-11-14)

- Rewrite the Flask backend (`backend/`, ≈86k lines without tests) in Go, on branch `go` of the fork
  (sunbroke555/configflow), worktree `~/program/configflow-go`. One full rewrite, no Python/Go
  coexistence. The maintainer is the project's maintainer; no upstream consent needed.
- **No lost features.** Every route in `parity/routes.tsv` (380 method+path pairs) and every background
  task must exist in Go. A gap found in a hand-back is sent back to the agent, not accepted.
- Not ported (decided): `backend/models/`, Python runtime tuning (`startup.py`, `http_server.py`,
  `http_queue.py` — Go-native tuning instead), pre-SQLite data migration (Go refuses legacy-only data
  dirs and asks to upgrade via the last Python release), the one-time managed-DNS cleanup, and any code
  without a caller. Details at the end of `parity/packages.md`.
- Subscriptions are parsed by the bundled Sub-Store; Go keeps Sub-Store and ports only its client (#13).
- Follow-up after parity (not during the port): Surge/Loon manual nodes via Sub-Store; listed in
  `parity/packages.md`.
- **All subagents use Opus 5.5** (`model: "opus"`). No per-risk model mix.
- Production (NAS panel, routers, DNS hosts) is never touched. High-risk (HR) packages get code and tests
  only; lab tests on PVE VMs happen after the maintainer agrees.

## Where things are

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `server/PORTING.md` | Rules every porting agent follows + API reference of every finished package. Update it after each verified package. |
| `server/parity/packages.md` | 41 work packages, dependency order, status (`todo`/`wip`/`done`/`lab`), not-ported list, follow-ups. |
| `server/parity/routes.tsv` | Every Flask route; agents fill `go package` + `status` for their rows. |
| `server/internal/...` | Go packages. `cmd/configflow` is the binary. |

## Status at handoff (2026-11-15 01:15)

Done and independently re-verified by the coordinator: #0 jsonx+store, #1 infra (yamlx, logx, …),
#2 repo, #3 httpx/auth/settings (+ the Go server replaces nginx), #4 rules (regex: RE2 + regexp2
fallback). Routes done: 22 of 380.

In progress when this file was written (the agents die if the session that started them ends; their
uncommitted files stay on disk):
- **#5 subs**: functionally done and verified; follow-up running to reduce refusals of the
  comment-preserving Mihomo YAML editor (realistic corpus of 128 repo configs already 0 refused /
  0 mismatches, commit f233dcb6; random corpora still refused 335/336 rows). Uncommitted at handoff:
  `subs/commented/*.go`, `numbers.go`, `testdata/commented_scalars.jsonl.gz`, `testdata/gen.py`, and a
  debug file `subs/zz_debug_test.go` that must not be committed.
- **#20 agent registry**: started 00:55, uncommitted `server/internal/agents/` at handoff.

If those agents are gone when you resume: inspect `git status`, run the package tests (below), and brief a
new Opus agent to finish from the files on disk (tell it what is committed, what is not, and what its brief
was — the briefs are reproduced in spirit by the template below).

## How a package is run

1. Pick the next `todo` package whose prerequisites are `done` (`parity/packages.md`). Run **at most 2
   agents at a time** (more burns the 5-hour usage window within an hour).
2. Brief a `general-purpose` agent with `model: "opus"` using the template below; mark the package `wip`.
3. When it hands back: re-run its tests yourself on the test server (commands below), including its
   Python differential/cross-check; read its "not ported / differences" list critically (lost features →
   send it back with `SendMessage`, which resumes the same agent).
4. When verified: paste its API reference into `PORTING.md` (above "Helpers from a package that is not
   ported yet"), set `done` in `packages.md`, commit (`go: …`, explicit paths) and `git push origin go`.
5. If an agent is cut off by the usage limit, resume it with `SendMessage` after the reset time; never start
   a fresh agent for the same package unless the old one is gone.

Brief template (adapt the package part; the agents already know the rest from PORTING.md):

> You are porting one work package of a Python (Flask) backend to Go. Worktree `~/program/configflow-go`
> (branch `go`). **Read `server/PORTING.md` completely first** (rules + API reference of the packages you
> build on), then `server/parity/packages.md` (your package is #N) and `server/parity/routes.tsv`.
> Package #N: <name>, Python sources <files> (read completely before writing). Scope rules: <what to
> port, what belongs to later packages behind hooks/interfaces, which routes to register>. Tests: port
> every Python test whose subject is in scope (<known files>), list the rest with the package they belong
> to; add a differential check against real Python on the test server (corpus via
> `PYTHONPATH=. ~/cf-test/.venv/bin/python`, or the Flask↔Go HTTP pattern in `internal/httpx/difftest`;
> synthetic values only, loopback only). Process: commit early and often with explicit paths, `go(<pkg>): …`,
> no push, no sub-agents, tests only via `rt`, only your packages; only edit `routePackages`/`wirePackages`
> in `internal/server/server.go` outside your package. Hand back: PORTING.md format + API reference,
> routes done/left, differences from Python, exact server commands and final output lines.

## Verification commands (run from the worktree; never on the Mac)

```
rt -- bash -lc 'cd server && gofmt -l internal/<pkg>; go vet ./internal/<pkg>/... && go test -count=1 ./internal/<pkg>/...'
# Python cross-checks that are env-gated:
rt -- bash -lc 'cd server && CONFIGFLOW_PY=$HOME/cf-test/.venv/bin/python CONFIGFLOW_REPO=$(cd .. && pwd) go test -count=1 -v ./internal/store/ ./internal/repo/'
rt -- bash -lc 'cd server && CONFIGFLOW_DIFF=1 go test -count=1 -v -run Differential ./internal/httpx/difftest/'
```

Use `rt --back <path inside one package>` only; never `--back server/internal` (it overwrote other agents'
files once). After `cf-test`, use `rt --no-sync`.

## Lessons so far

- Usage: each package agent costs 300–500k tokens; parallel agents and agents that fork helpers exhausted
  the window twice. A very long coordinator context makes every wake-up expensive: start a fresh
  coordinator session from this file rather than continuing an old one.
- Agents on Sonnet once shipped "never matches" for unsupported regexes (a lost feature) — always read the
  differences list.
- Agents' hand-backs overstate nothing so far, but run their tests yourself anyway; they sometimes leave
  gofmt or debug files behind.
- Event-driven is enough: hand-backs and completions wake the coordinator. A recurring cron is only a
  fallback for resuming agents after a usage-limit reset (session-only, expires after 7 days).
