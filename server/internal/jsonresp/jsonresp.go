// Package jsonresp is the pure part of backend/common/json_response.py: the
// byte-exact encoding behind jsonify_external and the check that lets the
// global response hook skip a second redaction. The HTTP glue (building the
// response, content type, running the redaction itself) belongs to
// internal/httpx and internal/api.
//
// What the httpx package has to add around this one:
//
//   - the secrets: config_export._external_payload_secrets() and
//     _sanitize_with_secrets(payload, secrets, sort_dict_keys=True) (package
//     #17); External takes the already redacted payload;
//   - the response: body = External(sanitized) with Content-Type
//     "application/json" and no trailing newline (unlike flask.jsonify);
//   - the marker: keep the Sanitized value next to the response (a field of the
//     response wrapper, never a header) and call Consume from the global
//     response hook, which skips redaction only when it returns true;
//   - the fallback: when PlainTree says false, use the ordinary jsonify path
//     (jsonx.Response) and let the hook redact.
